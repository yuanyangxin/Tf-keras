# Tf-keras

In this project, I get familiar with Tf-keras.

We use two datasets: California Housing dataset(for regression) and fashion_mnist(for classification)

We use tf-keras to implement deep neural network and wide&deep. 

Finally, we implemented the hyperparametric search by writing codes by myself and calling sklearn respectively.
